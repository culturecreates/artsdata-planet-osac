This exhibition features drawings, felt sculptures, and painted tiles. Kristin states: \"The specimens came to life in 2012 in the form of a charcoal gestural sketch. The idea of sculpting them in wool followed. Wool allowed me to use bright colours and to create sculptures that were malleable. A tactile person, I wanted to play with my sculptures. This idea of being able to play with and manipulate the sculptures inspired the tiles; they are all able to interconnect with each other on all four sides. An important aspect of them was the ability to create different paths between the specimens by physically moving the tiles, or as a viewer, by following the shapes as they weave through the installation. I often alternate between two and three dimensions as I work. \n\nThey are surprisingly autobiographical.  I have always had a fascination with botany and nature, and a love of the unique shapes found in the natural and microscopic world. This, combined with my love of colour, has resulted in this series of playful sculptures and drawings that explore the ideas of interconnection, growth, spontaneity, and evolution.\"ExhibitionsThu, Aug 1, 2024 to Mon, Sep 23, 2024 at the Last Mountain Lake Cultural Centre - Regina Beach, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Sun, Dec 1, 2024 to Mon, Dec 23, 2024 at the Mistasinihk Place - La Ronge, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Moosomin & District Arts Council - Moosomin, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Indian Head Theatre and Community Arts Inc. - Indian Head, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Wed, Jul 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Mon, Dec 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Thu, Jan 1, 2026 to Mon, Feb 23, 2026 at the Station Arts Centre Cooperative - Rosthern, SK.Wed, Apr 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Sep 1, 2026 to Wed, Sep 23, 2026 at the Central Park Library/Arts Centre - Nipawin, SK.Thu, Oct 1, 2026 to Mon, Nov 23, 2026 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Tue, Dec 1, 2026 to Sat, Jan 23, 2027 at the John V.

This exhibition features drawings, felt sculptures, and painted tiles. Kristin states: \"The specimens came to life in 2012 in the form of a charcoal gestural sketch. The idea of sculpting them in wool followed. Wool allowed me to use bright colours and to create sculptures that were malleable. A tactile person, I wanted to play with my sculptures. This idea of being able to play with and manipulate the sculptures inspired the tiles; they are all able to interconnect with each other on all four sides. An important aspect of them was the ability to create different paths between the specimens by physically moving the tiles, or as a viewer, by following the shapes as they weave through the installation. I often alternate between two and three dimensions as I work. \n\nThey are surprisingly autobiographical.  I have always had a fascination with botany and nature, and a love of the unique shapes found in the natural and microscopic world. This, combined with my love of colour, has resulted in this series of playful sculptures and drawings that explore the ideas of interconnection, growth, spontaneity, and evolution.\"ExhibitionsThu, Aug 1, 2024 to Mon, Sep 23, 2024 at the Last Mountain Lake Cultural Centre - Regina Beach, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Sun, Dec 1, 2024 to Mon, Dec 23, 2024 at the Mistasinihk Place - La Ronge, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Moosomin & District Arts Council - Moosomin, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Indian Head Theatre and Community Arts Inc. - Indian Head, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Wed, Jul 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Mon, Dec 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Thu, Jan 1, 2026 to Mon, Feb 23, 2026 at the Station Arts Centre Cooperative - Rosthern, SK.Wed, Apr 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Sep 1, 2026 to Wed, Sep 23, 2026 at the Central Park Library/Arts Centre - Nipawin, SK.Thu, Oct 1, 2026 to Mon, Nov 23, 2026 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Tue, Dec 1, 2026 to Sat, Jan 23, 2027 at the John V.
