This exhibition features drawings, felt sculptures, and painted tiles. Kristin states: \"The specimens came to life in 2012 in the form of a charcoal gestural sketch. The idea of sculpting them in wool followed. Wool allowed me to use bright colours and to create sculptures that were malleable. A tactile person, I wanted to play with my sculptures. This idea of being able to play with and manipulate the sculptures inspired the tiles; they are all able to interconnect with each other on all four sides. An important aspect of them was the ability to create different paths between the specimens by physically moving the tiles, or as a viewer, by following the shapes as they weave through the installation.

This exhibition features drawings, felt sculptures, and painted tiles. Kristin states: \"The specimens came to life in 2012 in the form of a charcoal gestural sketch. The idea of sculpting them in wool followed. Wool allowed me to use bright colours and to create sculptures that were malleable. A tactile person, I wanted to play with my sculptures. This idea of being able to play with and manipulate the sculptures inspired the tiles; they are all able to interconnect with each other on all four sides. An important aspect of them was the ability to create different paths between the specimens by physically moving the tiles, or as a viewer, by following the shapes as they weave through the installation. I often alternate between two and three dimensions as I work. \n\nThey are surprisingly autobiographical.  I have always had a fascination with botany and nature, and a love of the unique shapes found in the natural and microscopic world. This, combined with my love of colour, has resulted in this series of playful sculptures and drawings that explore the ideas of interconnection, growth, spontaneity, and evolution.\"ExhibitionsThu, Aug 1, 2024 to Mon, Sep 23, 2024 at the Last Mountain Lake Cultural Centre - Regina Beach, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Sun, Dec 1, 2024 to Mon, Dec 23, 2024 at the Mistasinihk Place - La Ronge, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Moosomin & District Arts Council - Moosomin, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Indian Head Theatre and Community Arts Inc. - Indian Head, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Wed, Jul 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Mon, Dec 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Thu, Jan 1, 2026 to Mon, Feb 23, 2026 at the Station Arts Centre Cooperative - Rosthern, SK.Wed, Apr 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Sep 1, 2026 to Wed, Sep 23, 2026 at the Central Park Library/Arts Centre - Nipawin, SK.Thu, Oct 1, 2026 to Mon, Nov 23, 2026 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Tue, Dec 1, 2026 to Sat, Jan 23, 2027 at the John V.

This, combined with my love of colour, has resulted in this series of playful sculptures and drawings that explore the ideas of interconnection, growth, spontaneity, and evolution.\"ExhibitionsThu, Aug 1, 2024 to Mon, Sep 23, 2024 at the Last Mountain Lake Cultural Centre - Regina Beach, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Sun, Dec 1, 2024 to Mon, Dec 23, 2024 at the Mistasinihk Place - La Ronge, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Moosomin & District Arts Council - Moosomin, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Indian Head Theatre and Community Arts Inc. - Indian Head, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Wed, Jul 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Mon, Dec 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Thu, Jan 1, 2026 to Mon, Feb 23, 2026 at the Station Arts Centre Cooperative - Rosthern, SK.Wed, Apr 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Sep 1, 2026 to Wed, Sep 23, 2026 at the Central Park Library/Arts Centre - Nipawin, SK.Thu, Oct 1, 2026 to Mon, Nov 23, 2026 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Tue, Dec 1, 2026 to Sat, Jan 23, 2027 at the John V.

Both artists present mundane objects within their compositions, objects of domesticity, consumption and memorialization, many that are linked historically to traditional vanitas or memento mori paintings - including candles, ceramic vessels and flowers - that represent the passage of time, aging, decay, the transience of life, the futility of pleasure, and the certainty of death. Their compositions explore the values and narratives that these objects come to symbolize. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by the Moose Jaw Museum & Art Gallery and toured through OSAC's Arts on the Move program.ExhibitionsSun, Sep 1, 2024 to Mon, Sep 23, 2024 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Watrous Art & Cultural Centre - Watrous, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the John V.

Both artists present mundane objects within their compositions, objects of domesticity, consumption and memorialization, many that are linked historically to traditional vanitas or memento mori paintings - including candles, ceramic vessels and flowers - that represent the passage of time, aging, decay, the transience of life, the futility of pleasure, and the certainty of death. Their compositions explore the values and narratives that these objects come to symbolize. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by the Moose Jaw Museum & Art Gallery and toured through OSAC's Arts on the Move program.ExhibitionsSun, Sep 1, 2024 to Mon, Sep 23, 2024 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Watrous Art & Cultural Centre - Watrous, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the John V.

As a toxic, uncontainable, and grossly over-produced material, it is also repulsive and surrounds me with dread and despair.  It is between opposites that I have created these objects: working to both deflect and deal with my own conflicting attitudes in a time of vast uncertainty, inexpressible emotions, and constant horror.  \n\nAll materials in the show were rescued from their fate as discarded objects, collected either from my own personal consumption habits (packaging waste) or from the thrift store (craft supplies, projects, decorations).ExhibitionsSun, Sep 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the John V.

As a toxic, uncontainable, and grossly over-produced material, it is also repulsive and surrounds me with dread and despair.  It is between opposites that I have created these objects: working to both deflect and deal with my own conflicting attitudes in a time of vast uncertainty, inexpressible emotions, and constant horror.  \n\nAll materials in the show were rescued from their fate as discarded objects, collected either from my own personal consumption habits (packaging waste) or from the thrift store (craft supplies, projects, decorations).ExhibitionsSun, Sep 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the John V.

The multimedia pieces represent the artists’ interpretations of the dog-human relationship as expressed through preliminary findings of a community-driven research project conducted in the community. This unique marriage of art and science allows knowledge translation to a broader audience than typical of peer-reviewed research. Highlighting the need for improved access to animal health and welfare services in northern, remote and Indigenous communities everywhere, this gallery represents a call to action for systemic change at the human-dog interface. Through their works, the artists confirm that dog-human bonds are highly valued and often critical to human life and well-being in the north, and current approaches to ‘fixing’ dog problems in communities without regular access to care ignore important contributors at the root of the issue. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by Dr. Jordan Woodsworth, Director, Northern Engagement and Community Outreach, Western College of Veterinary Medicine. The artists featured in this exhibition are: Andrea Cowan, Caron Dubnick, Donna Langhorne, Hilary Johnstone, John Halkett, Larissa Muirhead, Miriam Koerner, Molly Ratt, Myles Charles, Nancy Lafleur, Terri Franks, Sammi Kopeck, Abigail Clarke, Annalisa Heppner, Jade Roberts, Jasmine Grondin, and Wendy Cleveland.ExhibitionsFri, Jun 21, 2024 to Fri, Aug 23, 2024 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Tisdale Community Library - Tisdale, SK.Sat, Mar 1, 2025 to Sun, Mar 23, 2025 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Wed, Apr 23, 2025 at the Grand Theatre - Indian Head, SK.Thu, May 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Sat, Aug 23, 2025 at the Weyburn Art Gallery - Weyburn, SK.Mon, Sep 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Art Gallery of Outlook - Outlook, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Mon, Jun 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Council Chambers, Leader Town Office - Leader, SK.Wed, Jul 1, 2026 to Sun, Aug 23, 2026 at the John V.

The multimedia pieces represent the artists’ interpretations of the dog-human relationship as expressed through preliminary findings of a community-driven research project conducted in the community. This unique marriage of art and science allows knowledge translation to a broader audience than typical of peer-reviewed research. Highlighting the need for improved access to animal health and welfare services in northern, remote and Indigenous communities everywhere, this gallery represents a call to action for systemic change at the human-dog interface. Through their works, the artists confirm that dog-human bonds are highly valued and often critical to human life and well-being in the north, and current approaches to ‘fixing’ dog problems in communities without regular access to care ignore important contributors at the root of the issue. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by Dr. Jordan Woodsworth, Director, Northern Engagement and Community Outreach, Western College of Veterinary Medicine. The artists featured in this exhibition are: Andrea Cowan, Caron Dubnick, Donna Langhorne, Hilary Johnstone, John Halkett, Larissa Muirhead, Miriam Koerner, Molly Ratt, Myles Charles, Nancy Lafleur, Terri Franks, Sammi Kopeck, Abigail Clarke, Annalisa Heppner, Jade Roberts, Jasmine Grondin, and Wendy Cleveland.ExhibitionsFri, Jun 21, 2024 to Fri, Aug 23, 2024 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Tisdale Community Library - Tisdale, SK.Sat, Mar 1, 2025 to Sun, Mar 23, 2025 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Wed, Apr 23, 2025 at the Grand Theatre - Indian Head, SK.Thu, May 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Sat, Aug 23, 2025 at the Weyburn Art Gallery - Weyburn, SK.Mon, Sep 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Art Gallery of Outlook - Outlook, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Mon, Jun 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Council Chambers, Leader Town Office - Leader, SK.Wed, Jul 1, 2026 to Sun, Aug 23, 2026 at the John V.

The multimedia pieces represent the artists’ interpretations of the dog-human relationship as expressed through preliminary findings of a community-driven research project conducted in the community. This unique marriage of art and science allows knowledge translation to a broader audience than typical of peer-reviewed research. Highlighting the need for improved access to animal health and welfare services in northern, remote and Indigenous communities everywhere, this gallery represents a call to action for systemic change at the human-dog interface. Through their works, the artists confirm that dog-human bonds are highly valued and often critical to human life and well-being in the north, and current approaches to ‘fixing’ dog problems in communities without regular access to care ignore important contributors at the root of the issue. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by Dr. Jordan Woodsworth, Director, Northern Engagement and Community Outreach, Western College of Veterinary Medicine. The artists featured in this exhibition are: Andrea Cowan, Caron Dubnick, Donna Langhorne, Hilary Johnstone, John Halkett, Larissa Muirhead, Miriam Koerner, Molly Ratt, Myles Charles, Nancy Lafleur, Terri Franks, Sammi Kopeck, Abigail Clarke, Annalisa Heppner, Jade Roberts, Jasmine Grondin, and Wendy Cleveland.ExhibitionsFri, Jun 21, 2024 to Fri, Aug 23, 2024 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Tisdale Community Library - Tisdale, SK.Sat, Mar 1, 2025 to Sun, Mar 23, 2025 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Wed, Apr 23, 2025 at the Grand Theatre - Indian Head, SK.Thu, May 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Sat, Aug 23, 2025 at the Weyburn Art Gallery - Weyburn, SK.Mon, Sep 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Art Gallery of Outlook - Outlook, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Mon, Jun 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Council Chambers, Leader Town Office - Leader, SK.Wed, Jul 1, 2026 to Sun, Aug 23, 2026 at the John V.

The multimedia pieces represent the artists’ interpretations of the dog-human relationship as expressed through preliminary findings of a community-driven research project conducted in the community. This unique marriage of art and science allows knowledge translation to a broader audience than typical of peer-reviewed research. Highlighting the need for improved access to animal health and welfare services in northern, remote and Indigenous communities everywhere, this gallery represents a call to action for systemic change at the human-dog interface. Through their works, the artists confirm that dog-human bonds are highly valued and often critical to human life and well-being in the north, and current approaches to ‘fixing’ dog problems in communities without regular access to care ignore important contributors at the root of the issue. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by Dr. Jordan Woodsworth, Director, Northern Engagement and Community Outreach, Western College of Veterinary Medicine. The artists featured in this exhibition are: Andrea Cowan, Caron Dubnick, Donna Langhorne, Hilary Johnstone, John Halkett, Larissa Muirhead, Miriam Koerner, Molly Ratt, Myles Charles, Nancy Lafleur, Terri Franks, Sammi Kopeck, Abigail Clarke, Annalisa Heppner, Jade Roberts, Jasmine Grondin, and Wendy Cleveland.ExhibitionsFri, Jun 21, 2024 to Fri, Aug 23, 2024 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Tisdale Community Library - Tisdale, SK.Sat, Mar 1, 2025 to Sun, Mar 23, 2025 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Wed, Apr 23, 2025 at the Grand Theatre - Indian Head, SK.Thu, May 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Sat, Aug 23, 2025 at the Weyburn Art Gallery - Weyburn, SK.Mon, Sep 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Art Gallery of Outlook - Outlook, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Mon, Jun 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Council Chambers, Leader Town Office - Leader, SK.Wed, Jul 1, 2026 to Sun, Aug 23, 2026 at the John V.

The multimedia pieces represent the artists’ interpretations of the dog-human relationship as expressed through preliminary findings of a community-driven research project conducted in the community. This unique marriage of art and science allows knowledge translation to a broader audience than typical of peer-reviewed research. Highlighting the need for improved access to animal health and welfare services in northern, remote and Indigenous communities everywhere, this gallery represents a call to action for systemic change at the human-dog interface. Through their works, the artists confirm that dog-human bonds are highly valued and often critical to human life and well-being in the north, and current approaches to ‘fixing’ dog problems in communities without regular access to care ignore important contributors at the root of the issue. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by Dr. Jordan Woodsworth, Director, Northern Engagement and Community Outreach, Western College of Veterinary Medicine. The artists featured in this exhibition are: Andrea Cowan, Caron Dubnick, Donna Langhorne, Hilary Johnstone, John Halkett, Larissa Muirhead, Miriam Koerner, Molly Ratt, Myles Charles, Nancy Lafleur, Terri Franks, Sammi Kopeck, Abigail Clarke, Annalisa Heppner, Jade Roberts, Jasmine Grondin, and Wendy Cleveland.ExhibitionsFri, Jun 21, 2024 to Fri, Aug 23, 2024 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Tisdale Community Library - Tisdale, SK.Sat, Mar 1, 2025 to Sun, Mar 23, 2025 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Wed, Apr 23, 2025 at the Grand Theatre - Indian Head, SK.Thu, May 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Sat, Aug 23, 2025 at the Weyburn Art Gallery - Weyburn, SK.Mon, Sep 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Art Gallery of Outlook - Outlook, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Mon, Jun 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Council Chambers, Leader Town Office - Leader, SK.Wed, Jul 1, 2026 to Sun, Aug 23, 2026 at the John V.

Highlighting the need for improved access to animal health and welfare services in northern, remote and Indigenous communities everywhere, this gallery represents a call to action for systemic change at the human-dog interface. Through their works, the artists confirm that dog-human bonds are highly valued and often critical to human life and well-being in the north, and current approaches to ‘fixing’ dog problems in communities without regular access to care ignore important contributors at the root of the issue. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by Dr. Jordan Woodsworth, Director, Northern Engagement and Community Outreach, Western College of Veterinary Medicine.

The multimedia pieces represent the artists’ interpretations of the dog-human relationship as expressed through preliminary findings of a community-driven research project conducted in the community. This unique marriage of art and science allows knowledge translation to a broader audience than typical of peer-reviewed research. Highlighting the need for improved access to animal health and welfare services in northern, remote and Indigenous communities everywhere, this gallery represents a call to action for systemic change at the human-dog interface. Through their works, the artists confirm that dog-human bonds are highly valued and often critical to human life and well-being in the north, and current approaches to ‘fixing’ dog problems in communities without regular access to care ignore important contributors at the root of the issue. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by Dr. Jordan Woodsworth, Director, Northern Engagement and Community Outreach, Western College of Veterinary Medicine. The artists featured in this exhibition are: Andrea Cowan, Caron Dubnick, Donna Langhorne, Hilary Johnstone, John Halkett, Larissa Muirhead, Miriam Koerner, Molly Ratt, Myles Charles, Nancy Lafleur, Terri Franks, Sammi Kopeck, Abigail Clarke, Annalisa Heppner, Jade Roberts, Jasmine Grondin, and Wendy Cleveland.ExhibitionsFri, Jun 21, 2024 to Fri, Aug 23, 2024 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Tisdale Community Library - Tisdale, SK.Sat, Mar 1, 2025 to Sun, Mar 23, 2025 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Wed, Apr 23, 2025 at the Grand Theatre - Indian Head, SK.Thu, May 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Sat, Aug 23, 2025 at the Weyburn Art Gallery - Weyburn, SK.Mon, Sep 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Art Gallery of Outlook - Outlook, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Mon, Jun 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Council Chambers, Leader Town Office - Leader, SK.Wed, Jul 1, 2026 to Sun, Aug 23, 2026 at the John V.

The multimedia pieces represent the artists’ interpretations of the dog-human relationship as expressed through preliminary findings of a community-driven research project conducted in the community. This unique marriage of art and science allows knowledge translation to a broader audience than typical of peer-reviewed research. Highlighting the need for improved access to animal health and welfare services in northern, remote and Indigenous communities everywhere, this gallery represents a call to action for systemic change at the human-dog interface. Through their works, the artists confirm that dog-human bonds are highly valued and often critical to human life and well-being in the north, and current approaches to ‘fixing’ dog problems in communities without regular access to care ignore important contributors at the root of the issue. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by Dr. Jordan Woodsworth, Director, Northern Engagement and Community Outreach, Western College of Veterinary Medicine. The artists featured in this exhibition are: Andrea Cowan, Caron Dubnick, Donna Langhorne, Hilary Johnstone, John Halkett, Larissa Muirhead, Miriam Koerner, Molly Ratt, Myles Charles, Nancy Lafleur, Terri Franks, Sammi Kopeck, Abigail Clarke, Annalisa Heppner, Jade Roberts, Jasmine Grondin, and Wendy Cleveland.ExhibitionsFri, Jun 21, 2024 to Fri, Aug 23, 2024 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Tisdale Community Library - Tisdale, SK.Sat, Mar 1, 2025 to Sun, Mar 23, 2025 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Wed, Apr 23, 2025 at the Grand Theatre - Indian Head, SK.Thu, May 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Sat, Aug 23, 2025 at the Weyburn Art Gallery - Weyburn, SK.Mon, Sep 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Art Gallery of Outlook - Outlook, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Mon, Jun 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Council Chambers, Leader Town Office - Leader, SK.Wed, Jul 1, 2026 to Sun, Aug 23, 2026 at the John V.

The multimedia pieces represent the artists’ interpretations of the dog-human relationship as expressed through preliminary findings of a community-driven research project conducted in the community. This unique marriage of art and science allows knowledge translation to a broader audience than typical of peer-reviewed research. Highlighting the need for improved access to animal health and welfare services in northern, remote and Indigenous communities everywhere, this gallery represents a call to action for systemic change at the human-dog interface. Through their works, the artists confirm that dog-human bonds are highly valued and often critical to human life and well-being in the north, and current approaches to ‘fixing’ dog problems in communities without regular access to care ignore important contributors at the root of the issue. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by Dr. Jordan Woodsworth, Director, Northern Engagement and Community Outreach, Western College of Veterinary Medicine. The artists featured in this exhibition are: Andrea Cowan, Caron Dubnick, Donna Langhorne, Hilary Johnstone, John Halkett, Larissa Muirhead, Miriam Koerner, Molly Ratt, Myles Charles, Nancy Lafleur, Terri Franks, Sammi Kopeck, Abigail Clarke, Annalisa Heppner, Jade Roberts, Jasmine Grondin, and Wendy Cleveland.ExhibitionsFri, Jun 21, 2024 to Fri, Aug 23, 2024 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Tisdale Community Library - Tisdale, SK.Sat, Mar 1, 2025 to Sun, Mar 23, 2025 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Wed, Apr 23, 2025 at the Grand Theatre - Indian Head, SK.Thu, May 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Sat, Aug 23, 2025 at the Weyburn Art Gallery - Weyburn, SK.Mon, Sep 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Art Gallery of Outlook - Outlook, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Mon, Jun 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Council Chambers, Leader Town Office - Leader, SK.Wed, Jul 1, 2026 to Sun, Aug 23, 2026 at the John V.

The multimedia pieces represent the artists’ interpretations of the dog-human relationship as expressed through preliminary findings of a community-driven research project conducted in the community. This unique marriage of art and science allows knowledge translation to a broader audience than typical of peer-reviewed research. Highlighting the need for improved access to animal health and welfare services in northern, remote and Indigenous communities everywhere, this gallery represents a call to action for systemic change at the human-dog interface. Through their works, the artists confirm that dog-human bonds are highly valued and often critical to human life and well-being in the north, and current approaches to ‘fixing’ dog problems in communities without regular access to care ignore important contributors at the root of the issue. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by Dr. Jordan Woodsworth, Director, Northern Engagement and Community Outreach, Western College of Veterinary Medicine. The artists featured in this exhibition are: Andrea Cowan, Caron Dubnick, Donna Langhorne, Hilary Johnstone, John Halkett, Larissa Muirhead, Miriam Koerner, Molly Ratt, Myles Charles, Nancy Lafleur, Terri Franks, Sammi Kopeck, Abigail Clarke, Annalisa Heppner, Jade Roberts, Jasmine Grondin, and Wendy Cleveland.ExhibitionsFri, Jun 21, 2024 to Fri, Aug 23, 2024 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Tisdale Community Library - Tisdale, SK.Sat, Mar 1, 2025 to Sun, Mar 23, 2025 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Wed, Apr 23, 2025 at the Grand Theatre - Indian Head, SK.Thu, May 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Sat, Aug 23, 2025 at the Weyburn Art Gallery - Weyburn, SK.Mon, Sep 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Art Gallery of Outlook - Outlook, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Mon, Jun 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Council Chambers, Leader Town Office - Leader, SK.Wed, Jul 1, 2026 to Sun, Aug 23, 2026 at the John V.

The multimedia pieces represent the artists’ interpretations of the dog-human relationship as expressed through preliminary findings of a community-driven research project conducted in the community. This unique marriage of art and science allows knowledge translation to a broader audience than typical of peer-reviewed research. Highlighting the need for improved access to animal health and welfare services in northern, remote and Indigenous communities everywhere, this gallery represents a call to action for systemic change at the human-dog interface. Through their works, the artists confirm that dog-human bonds are highly valued and often critical to human life and well-being in the north, and current approaches to ‘fixing’ dog problems in communities without regular access to care ignore important contributors at the root of the issue. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by Dr. Jordan Woodsworth, Director, Northern Engagement and Community Outreach, Western College of Veterinary Medicine.

The multimedia pieces represent the artists’ interpretations of the dog-human relationship as expressed through preliminary findings of a community-driven research project conducted in the community. This unique marriage of art and science allows knowledge translation to a broader audience than typical of peer-reviewed research. Highlighting the need for improved access to animal health and welfare services in northern, remote and Indigenous communities everywhere, this gallery represents a call to action for systemic change at the human-dog interface. Through their works, the artists confirm that dog-human bonds are highly valued and often critical to human life and well-being in the north, and current approaches to ‘fixing’ dog problems in communities without regular access to care ignore important contributors at the root of the issue. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by Dr. Jordan Woodsworth, Director, Northern Engagement and Community Outreach, Western College of Veterinary Medicine.

The multimedia pieces represent the artists’ interpretations of the dog-human relationship as expressed through preliminary findings of a community-driven research project conducted in the community. This unique marriage of art and science allows knowledge translation to a broader audience than typical of peer-reviewed research. Highlighting the need for improved access to animal health and welfare services in northern, remote and Indigenous communities everywhere, this gallery represents a call to action for systemic change at the human-dog interface. Through their works, the artists confirm that dog-human bonds are highly valued and often critical to human life and well-being in the north, and current approaches to ‘fixing’ dog problems in communities without regular access to care ignore important contributors at the root of the issue. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by Dr. Jordan Woodsworth, Director, Northern Engagement and Community Outreach, Western College of Veterinary Medicine. The artists featured in this exhibition are: Andrea Cowan, Caron Dubnick, Donna Langhorne, Hilary Johnstone, John Halkett, Larissa Muirhead, Miriam Koerner, Molly Ratt, Myles Charles, Nancy Lafleur, Terri Franks, Sammi Kopeck, Abigail Clarke, Annalisa Heppner, Jade Roberts, Jasmine Grondin, and Wendy Cleveland.ExhibitionsFri, Jun 21, 2024 to Fri, Aug 23, 2024 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Tisdale Community Library - Tisdale, SK.Sat, Mar 1, 2025 to Sun, Mar 23, 2025 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Wed, Apr 23, 2025 at the Grand Theatre - Indian Head, SK.Thu, May 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Sat, Aug 23, 2025 at the Weyburn Art Gallery - Weyburn, SK.Mon, Sep 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Art Gallery of Outlook - Outlook, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Mon, Jun 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Council Chambers, Leader Town Office - Leader, SK.Wed, Jul 1, 2026 to Sun, Aug 23, 2026 at the John V.

The multimedia pieces represent the artists’ interpretations of the dog-human relationship as expressed through preliminary findings of a community-driven research project conducted in the community. This unique marriage of art and science allows knowledge translation to a broader audience than typical of peer-reviewed research. Highlighting the need for improved access to animal health and welfare services in northern, remote and Indigenous communities everywhere, this gallery represents a call to action for systemic change at the human-dog interface. Through their works, the artists confirm that dog-human bonds are highly valued and often critical to human life and well-being in the north, and current approaches to ‘fixing’ dog problems in communities without regular access to care ignore important contributors at the root of the issue. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by Dr. Jordan Woodsworth, Director, Northern Engagement and Community Outreach, Western College of Veterinary Medicine. The artists featured in this exhibition are: Andrea Cowan, Caron Dubnick, Donna Langhorne, Hilary Johnstone, John Halkett, Larissa Muirhead, Miriam Koerner, Molly Ratt, Myles Charles, Nancy Lafleur, Terri Franks, Sammi Kopeck, Abigail Clarke, Annalisa Heppner, Jade Roberts, Jasmine Grondin, and Wendy Cleveland.ExhibitionsFri, Jun 21, 2024 to Fri, Aug 23, 2024 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Tisdale Community Library - Tisdale, SK.Sat, Mar 1, 2025 to Sun, Mar 23, 2025 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Wed, Apr 23, 2025 at the Grand Theatre - Indian Head, SK.Thu, May 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Sat, Aug 23, 2025 at the Weyburn Art Gallery - Weyburn, SK.Mon, Sep 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Art Gallery of Outlook - Outlook, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Mon, Jun 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Council Chambers, Leader Town Office - Leader, SK.Wed, Jul 1, 2026 to Sun, Aug 23, 2026 at the John V.

The multimedia pieces represent the artists’ interpretations of the dog-human relationship as expressed through preliminary findings of a community-driven research project conducted in the community. This unique marriage of art and science allows knowledge translation to a broader audience than typical of peer-reviewed research. Highlighting the need for improved access to animal health and welfare services in northern, remote and Indigenous communities everywhere, this gallery represents a call to action for systemic change at the human-dog interface. Through their works, the artists confirm that dog-human bonds are highly valued and often critical to human life and well-being in the north, and current approaches to ‘fixing’ dog problems in communities without regular access to care ignore important contributors at the root of the issue. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by Dr. Jordan Woodsworth, Director, Northern Engagement and Community Outreach, Western College of Veterinary Medicine. The artists featured in this exhibition are: Andrea Cowan, Caron Dubnick, Donna Langhorne, Hilary Johnstone, John Halkett, Larissa Muirhead, Miriam Koerner, Molly Ratt, Myles Charles, Nancy Lafleur, Terri Franks, Sammi Kopeck, Abigail Clarke, Annalisa Heppner, Jade Roberts, Jasmine Grondin, and Wendy Cleveland.ExhibitionsFri, Jun 21, 2024 to Fri, Aug 23, 2024 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Tisdale Community Library - Tisdale, SK.Sat, Mar 1, 2025 to Sun, Mar 23, 2025 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Wed, Apr 23, 2025 at the Grand Theatre - Indian Head, SK.Thu, May 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Sat, Aug 23, 2025 at the Weyburn Art Gallery - Weyburn, SK.Mon, Sep 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Art Gallery of Outlook - Outlook, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Mon, Jun 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Council Chambers, Leader Town Office - Leader, SK.Wed, Jul 1, 2026 to Sun, Aug 23, 2026 at the John V.

The multimedia pieces represent the artists’ interpretations of the dog-human relationship as expressed through preliminary findings of a community-driven research project conducted in the community. This unique marriage of art and science allows knowledge translation to a broader audience than typical of peer-reviewed research. Highlighting the need for improved access to animal health and welfare services in northern, remote and Indigenous communities everywhere, this gallery represents a call to action for systemic change at the human-dog interface. Through their works, the artists confirm that dog-human bonds are highly valued and often critical to human life and well-being in the north, and current approaches to ‘fixing’ dog problems in communities without regular access to care ignore important contributors at the root of the issue. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by Dr. Jordan Woodsworth, Director, Northern Engagement and Community Outreach, Western College of Veterinary Medicine. The artists featured in this exhibition are: Andrea Cowan, Caron Dubnick, Donna Langhorne, Hilary Johnstone, John Halkett, Larissa Muirhead, Miriam Koerner, Molly Ratt, Myles Charles, Nancy Lafleur, Terri Franks, Sammi Kopeck, Abigail Clarke, Annalisa Heppner, Jade Roberts, Jasmine Grondin, and Wendy Cleveland.ExhibitionsFri, Jun 21, 2024 to Fri, Aug 23, 2024 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Tisdale Community Library - Tisdale, SK.Sat, Mar 1, 2025 to Sun, Mar 23, 2025 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Wed, Apr 23, 2025 at the Grand Theatre - Indian Head, SK.Thu, May 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Sat, Aug 23, 2025 at the Weyburn Art Gallery - Weyburn, SK.Mon, Sep 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Art Gallery of Outlook - Outlook, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Mon, Jun 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Council Chambers, Leader Town Office - Leader, SK.Wed, Jul 1, 2026 to Sun, Aug 23, 2026 at the John V.

The multimedia pieces represent the artists’ interpretations of the dog-human relationship as expressed through preliminary findings of a community-driven research project conducted in the community. This unique marriage of art and science allows knowledge translation to a broader audience than typical of peer-reviewed research. Highlighting the need for improved access to animal health and welfare services in northern, remote and Indigenous communities everywhere, this gallery represents a call to action for systemic change at the human-dog interface. Through their works, the artists confirm that dog-human bonds are highly valued and often critical to human life and well-being in the north, and current approaches to ‘fixing’ dog problems in communities without regular access to care ignore important contributors at the root of the issue. \n\nThis exhibition is curated by Dr. Jordan Woodsworth, Director, Northern Engagement and Community Outreach, Western College of Veterinary Medicine. The artists featured in this exhibition are: Andrea Cowan, Caron Dubnick, Donna Langhorne, Hilary Johnstone, John Halkett, Larissa Muirhead, Miriam Koerner, Molly Ratt, Myles Charles, Nancy Lafleur, Terri Franks, Sammi Kopeck, Abigail Clarke, Annalisa Heppner, Jade Roberts, Jasmine Grondin, and Wendy Cleveland.ExhibitionsFri, Jun 21, 2024 to Fri, Aug 23, 2024 at the Estevan Art Gallery & Museum - Estevan, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Tisdale Community Library - Tisdale, SK.Sat, Mar 1, 2025 to Sun, Mar 23, 2025 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Wed, Apr 23, 2025 at the Grand Theatre - Indian Head, SK.Thu, May 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Sat, Aug 23, 2025 at the Weyburn Art Gallery - Weyburn, SK.Mon, Sep 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Art Gallery of Outlook - Outlook, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Mon, Jun 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Council Chambers, Leader Town Office - Leader, SK.Wed, Jul 1, 2026 to Sun, Aug 23, 2026 at the John V.

The exhibition celebrates the various practices in Indigenous art, ranging from contemporary aesthetics and materials to those rooted in familial traditions.\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, the dedication and labour of love invested in art can be easily overlooked. The concept of \"Labour of love\" in art emphasises the extensive labour involved in the creation process, often infused with familial stories, teachings, and practices passed down through generations. These expressions of love for the practice and culture are condensed into the final artworks, representing hours of devotion and labour. We invite viewers to turn the lamplight on, consider the time and knowledge behind each piece as the artists skilfully worked with familiar and lesser-known materials, revived from their cultural heritage or passed down through mentorship within the art community. For many Indigenous artists, their love for their culture serves as a significant motivation in their artistic journey, enriching the contemporary art scene with an inherent connection to their roots.\n\nThis exhibition is curated by Holly Aubichon from recent acquisitions to the SK Arts Permanent collection and features the following artists: Stacey Fayant, Marcy Friesen, Sally Milne, Brandon Roy, Cherelle Williams, Audra Blais-Boulianne, Maureen Ledoux, Russel Iron, Elaine McArthur, and Jordy Ironstar.ExhibitionsSun, Sep 1, 2024 to Mon, Sep 23, 2024 at the Mistasinihk Place - La Ronge, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Indian Head Theatre and Community Arts Inc. - Indian Head, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Fri, Aug 1, 2025 to Tue, Sep 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Wed, Oct 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Station Arts Centre Cooperative - Rosthern, SK.Thu, Jan 1, 2026 to Mon, Feb 23, 2026 at the Grand Coteau Heritage and Cultural Centre - Shaunavon, SK.Wed, Apr 1, 2026 to Thu, Apr 23, 2026 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Fri, May 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Humboldt and District Gallery - Humboldt, SK.Sun, Nov 1, 2026 to Mon, Nov 23, 2026 at the John V.

The exhibition celebrates the various practices in Indigenous art, ranging from contemporary aesthetics and materials to those rooted in familial traditions.\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, the dedication and labour of love invested in art can be easily overlooked. The concept of \"Labour of love\" in art emphasises the extensive labour involved in the creation process, often infused with familial stories, teachings, and practices passed down through generations. These expressions of love for the practice and culture are condensed into the final artworks, representing hours of devotion and labour. We invite viewers to turn the lamplight on, consider the time and knowledge behind each piece as the artists skilfully worked with familiar and lesser-known materials, revived from their cultural heritage or passed down through mentorship within the art community. For many Indigenous artists, their love for their culture serves as a significant motivation in their artistic journey, enriching the contemporary art scene with an inherent connection to their roots.\n\nThis exhibition is curated by Holly Aubichon from recent acquisitions to the SK Arts Permanent collection and features the following artists: Stacey Fayant, Marcy Friesen, Sally Milne, Brandon Roy, Cherelle Williams, Audra Blais-Boulianne, Maureen Ledoux, Russel Iron, Elaine McArthur, and Jordy Ironstar.ExhibitionsSun, Sep 1, 2024 to Mon, Sep 23, 2024 at the Mistasinihk Place - La Ronge, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Indian Head Theatre and Community Arts Inc. - Indian Head, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Fri, Aug 1, 2025 to Tue, Sep 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Wed, Oct 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Station Arts Centre Cooperative - Rosthern, SK.Thu, Jan 1, 2026 to Mon, Feb 23, 2026 at the Grand Coteau Heritage and Cultural Centre - Shaunavon, SK.Wed, Apr 1, 2026 to Thu, Apr 23, 2026 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Fri, May 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Humboldt and District Gallery - Humboldt, SK.Sun, Nov 1, 2026 to Mon, Nov 23, 2026 at the John V.

The exhibition celebrates the various practices in Indigenous art, ranging from contemporary aesthetics and materials to those rooted in familial traditions.\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, the dedication and labour of love invested in art can be easily overlooked. The concept of \"Labour of love\" in art emphasises the extensive labour involved in the creation process, often infused with familial stories, teachings, and practices passed down through generations. These expressions of love for the practice and culture are condensed into the final artworks, representing hours of devotion and labour. We invite viewers to turn the lamplight on, consider the time and knowledge behind each piece as the artists skilfully worked with familiar and lesser-known materials, revived from their cultural heritage or passed down through mentorship within the art community. For many Indigenous artists, their love for their culture serves as a significant motivation in their artistic journey, enriching the contemporary art scene with an inherent connection to their roots.\n\nThis exhibition is curated by Holly Aubichon from recent acquisitions to the SK Arts Permanent collection and features the following artists: Stacey Fayant, Marcy Friesen, Sally Milne, Brandon Roy, Cherelle Williams, Audra Blais-Boulianne, Maureen Ledoux, Russel Iron, Elaine McArthur, and Jordy Ironstar.ExhibitionsSun, Sep 1, 2024 to Mon, Sep 23, 2024 at the Mistasinihk Place - La Ronge, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Indian Head Theatre and Community Arts Inc. - Indian Head, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Fri, Aug 1, 2025 to Tue, Sep 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Wed, Oct 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Station Arts Centre Cooperative - Rosthern, SK.Thu, Jan 1, 2026 to Mon, Feb 23, 2026 at the Grand Coteau Heritage and Cultural Centre - Shaunavon, SK.Wed, Apr 1, 2026 to Thu, Apr 23, 2026 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Fri, May 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Humboldt and District Gallery - Humboldt, SK.Sun, Nov 1, 2026 to Mon, Nov 23, 2026 at the John V.

The exhibition celebrates the various practices in Indigenous art, ranging from contemporary aesthetics and materials to those rooted in familial traditions.\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, the dedication and labour of love invested in art can be easily overlooked. The concept of \"Labour of love\" in art emphasises the extensive labour involved in the creation process, often infused with familial stories, teachings, and practices passed down through generations. These expressions of love for the practice and culture are condensed into the final artworks, representing hours of devotion and labour. We invite viewers to turn the lamplight on, consider the time and knowledge behind each piece as the artists skilfully worked with familiar and lesser-known materials, revived from their cultural heritage or passed down through mentorship within the art community. For many Indigenous artists, their love for their culture serves as a significant motivation in their artistic journey, enriching the contemporary art scene with an inherent connection to their roots.\n\nThis exhibition is curated by Holly Aubichon from recent acquisitions to the SK Arts Permanent collection and features the following artists: Stacey Fayant, Marcy Friesen, Sally Milne, Brandon Roy, Cherelle Williams, Audra Blais-Boulianne, Maureen Ledoux, Russel Iron, Elaine McArthur, and Jordy Ironstar.ExhibitionsSun, Sep 1, 2024 to Mon, Sep 23, 2024 at the Mistasinihk Place - La Ronge, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Indian Head Theatre and Community Arts Inc. - Indian Head, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Fri, Aug 1, 2025 to Tue, Sep 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Wed, Oct 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Station Arts Centre Cooperative - Rosthern, SK.Thu, Jan 1, 2026 to Mon, Feb 23, 2026 at the Grand Coteau Heritage and Cultural Centre - Shaunavon, SK.Wed, Apr 1, 2026 to Thu, Apr 23, 2026 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Fri, May 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Humboldt and District Gallery - Humboldt, SK.Sun, Nov 1, 2026 to Mon, Nov 23, 2026 at the John V.

The exhibition celebrates the various practices in Indigenous art, ranging from contemporary aesthetics and materials to those rooted in familial traditions.\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, the dedication and labour of love invested in art can be easily overlooked. The concept of \"Labour of love\" in art emphasises the extensive labour involved in the creation process, often infused with familial stories, teachings, and practices passed down through generations. These expressions of love for the practice and culture are condensed into the final artworks, representing hours of devotion and labour. We invite viewers to turn the lamplight on, consider the time and knowledge behind each piece as the artists skilfully worked with familiar and lesser-known materials, revived from their cultural heritage or passed down through mentorship within the art community. For many Indigenous artists, their love for their culture serves as a significant motivation in their artistic journey, enriching the contemporary art scene with an inherent connection to their roots.\n\nThis exhibition is curated by Holly Aubichon from recent acquisitions to the SK Arts Permanent collection and features the following artists: Stacey Fayant, Marcy Friesen, Sally Milne, Brandon Roy, Cherelle Williams, Audra Blais-Boulianne, Maureen Ledoux, Russel Iron, Elaine McArthur, and Jordy Ironstar.ExhibitionsSun, Sep 1, 2024 to Mon, Sep 23, 2024 at the Mistasinihk Place - La Ronge, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Indian Head Theatre and Community Arts Inc. - Indian Head, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Fri, Aug 1, 2025 to Tue, Sep 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Wed, Oct 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Station Arts Centre Cooperative - Rosthern, SK.Thu, Jan 1, 2026 to Mon, Feb 23, 2026 at the Grand Coteau Heritage and Cultural Centre - Shaunavon, SK.Wed, Apr 1, 2026 to Thu, Apr 23, 2026 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Fri, May 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Humboldt and District Gallery - Humboldt, SK.Sun, Nov 1, 2026 to Mon, Nov 23, 2026 at the John V.

These expressions of love for the practice and culture are condensed into the final artworks, representing hours of devotion and labour. We invite viewers to turn the lamplight on, consider the time and knowledge behind each piece as the artists skilfully worked with familiar and lesser-known materials, revived from their cultural heritage or passed down through mentorship within the art community. For many Indigenous artists, their love for their culture serves as a significant motivation in their artistic journey, enriching the contemporary art scene with an inherent connection to their roots.\n\nThis exhibition is curated by Holly Aubichon from recent acquisitions to the SK Arts Permanent collection and features the following artists: Stacey Fayant, Marcy Friesen, Sally Milne, Brandon Roy, Cherelle Williams, Audra Blais-Boulianne, Maureen Ledoux, Russel Iron, Elaine McArthur, and Jordy Ironstar.ExhibitionsSun, Sep 1, 2024 to Mon, Sep 23, 2024 at the Mistasinihk Place - La Ronge, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Indian Head Theatre and Community Arts Inc. - Indian Head, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Fri, Aug 1, 2025 to Tue, Sep 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Wed, Oct 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Station Arts Centre Cooperative - Rosthern, SK.Thu, Jan 1, 2026 to Mon, Feb 23, 2026 at the Grand Coteau Heritage and Cultural Centre - Shaunavon, SK.Wed, Apr 1, 2026 to Thu, Apr 23, 2026 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Fri, May 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Humboldt and District Gallery - Humboldt, SK.Sun, Nov 1, 2026 to Mon, Nov 23, 2026 at the John V.

The exhibition celebrates the various practices in Indigenous art, ranging from contemporary aesthetics and materials to those rooted in familial traditions.\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, the dedication and labour of love invested in art can be easily overlooked. The concept of \"Labour of love\" in art emphasises the extensive labour involved in the creation process, often infused with familial stories, teachings, and practices passed down through generations. These expressions of love for the practice and culture are condensed into the final artworks, representing hours of devotion and labour. We invite viewers to turn the lamplight on, consider the time and knowledge behind each piece as the artists skilfully worked with familiar and lesser-known materials, revived from their cultural heritage or passed down through mentorship within the art community. For many Indigenous artists, their love for their culture serves as a significant motivation in their artistic journey, enriching the contemporary art scene with an inherent connection to their roots.\n\nThis exhibition is curated by Holly Aubichon from recent acquisitions to the SK Arts Permanent collection and features the following artists: Stacey Fayant, Marcy Friesen, Sally Milne, Brandon Roy, Cherelle Williams, Audra Blais-Boulianne, Maureen Ledoux, Russel Iron, Elaine McArthur, and Jordy Ironstar.ExhibitionsSun, Sep 1, 2024 to Mon, Sep 23, 2024 at the Mistasinihk Place - La Ronge, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Indian Head Theatre and Community Arts Inc. - Indian Head, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Fri, Aug 1, 2025 to Tue, Sep 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Wed, Oct 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Station Arts Centre Cooperative - Rosthern, SK.Thu, Jan 1, 2026 to Mon, Feb 23, 2026 at the Grand Coteau Heritage and Cultural Centre - Shaunavon, SK.Wed, Apr 1, 2026 to Thu, Apr 23, 2026 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Fri, May 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Humboldt and District Gallery - Humboldt, SK.Sun, Nov 1, 2026 to Mon, Nov 23, 2026 at the John V.

The exhibition celebrates the various practices in Indigenous art, ranging from contemporary aesthetics and materials to those rooted in familial traditions.\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, the dedication and labour of love invested in art can be easily overlooked. The concept of \"Labour of love\" in art emphasises the extensive labour involved in the creation process, often infused with familial stories, teachings, and practices passed down through generations. These expressions of love for the practice and culture are condensed into the final artworks, representing hours of devotion and labour. We invite viewers to turn the lamplight on, consider the time and knowledge behind each piece as the artists skilfully worked with familiar and lesser-known materials, revived from their cultural heritage or passed down through mentorship within the art community. For many Indigenous artists, their love for their culture serves as a significant motivation in their artistic journey, enriching the contemporary art scene with an inherent connection to their roots.\n\nThis exhibition is curated by Holly Aubichon from recent acquisitions to the SK Arts Permanent collection and features the following artists: Stacey Fayant, Marcy Friesen, Sally Milne, Brandon Roy, Cherelle Williams, Audra Blais-Boulianne, Maureen Ledoux, Russel Iron, Elaine McArthur, and Jordy Ironstar.ExhibitionsSun, Sep 1, 2024 to Mon, Sep 23, 2024 at the Mistasinihk Place - La Ronge, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Indian Head Theatre and Community Arts Inc. - Indian Head, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Fri, Aug 1, 2025 to Tue, Sep 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Wed, Oct 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Station Arts Centre Cooperative - Rosthern, SK.Thu, Jan 1, 2026 to Mon, Feb 23, 2026 at the Grand Coteau Heritage and Cultural Centre - Shaunavon, SK.Wed, Apr 1, 2026 to Thu, Apr 23, 2026 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Fri, May 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Humboldt and District Gallery - Humboldt, SK.Sun, Nov 1, 2026 to Mon, Nov 23, 2026 at the John V.

Hicks Gallery at the Margo Fournier Arts CentreCommunity: Prince Albert Council for the Arts \n  \n\t\t\t\t  Elaine McArthur, Junior Girl's Jingle Dress Buddy, fabric, felt, paints, thread, ribbon, craft foam, yarn, 2022, 51.00 x 41.00 x 8.50 cm.\n\t\t\t\t Labours of Love, Under Lamplight is an exhibition featuring art from Indigenous artists in Saskatchewan, showcasing a diverse array of experiences and interpretations of Indigenous Art. The exhibition celebrates the various practices in Indigenous art, ranging from contemporary aesthetics and materials to those rooted in familial traditions.\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, the dedication and labour of love invested in art can be easily overlooked. The concept of \"Labour of love\" in art emphasises the extensive labour involved in the creation process, often infused with familial stories, teachings, and practices passed down through generations. These expressions of love for the practice and culture are condensed into the final artworks, representing hours of devotion and labour. We invite viewers to turn the lamplight on, consider the time and knowledge behind each piece as the artists skilfully worked with familiar and lesser-known materials, revived from their cultural heritage or passed down through mentorship within the art community. For many Indigenous artists, their love for their culture serves as a significant motivation in their artistic journey, enriching the contemporary art scene with an inherent connection to their roots.\n\nThis exhibition is curated by Holly Aubichon from recent acquisitions to the SK Arts Permanent collection and features the following artists: Stacey Fayant, Marcy Friesen, Sally Milne, Brandon Roy, Cherelle Williams, Audra Blais-Boulianne, Maureen Ledoux, Russel Iron, Elaine McArthur, and Jordy Ironstar.ExhibitionsSun, Sep 1, 2024 to Mon, Sep 23, 2024 at the Mistasinihk Place - La Ronge, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Indian Head Theatre and Community Arts Inc. - Indian Head, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Fri, Aug 1, 2025 to Tue, Sep 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Wed, Oct 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Station Arts Centre Cooperative - Rosthern, SK.Thu, Jan 1, 2026 to Mon, Feb 23, 2026 at the Grand Coteau Heritage and Cultural Centre - Shaunavon, SK.Wed, Apr 1, 2026 to Thu, Apr 23, 2026 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Fri, May 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Humboldt and District Gallery - Humboldt, SK.Sun, Nov 1, 2026 to Mon, Nov 23, 2026 at the John V.

The exhibition celebrates the various practices in Indigenous art, ranging from contemporary aesthetics and materials to those rooted in familial traditions.\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, the dedication and labour of love invested in art can be easily overlooked. The concept of \"Labour of love\" in art emphasises the extensive labour involved in the creation process, often infused with familial stories, teachings, and practices passed down through generations. These expressions of love for the practice and culture are condensed into the final artworks, representing hours of devotion and labour. We invite viewers to turn the lamplight on, consider the time and knowledge behind each piece as the artists skilfully worked with familiar and lesser-known materials, revived from their cultural heritage or passed down through mentorship within the art community. For many Indigenous artists, their love for their culture serves as a significant motivation in their artistic journey, enriching the contemporary art scene with an inherent connection to their roots.\n\nThis exhibition is curated by Holly Aubichon from recent acquisitions to the SK Arts Permanent collection and features the following artists: Stacey Fayant, Marcy Friesen, Sally Milne, Brandon Roy, Cherelle Williams, Audra Blais-Boulianne, Maureen Ledoux, Russel Iron, Elaine McArthur, and Jordy Ironstar.ExhibitionsSun, Sep 1, 2024 to Mon, Sep 23, 2024 at the Mistasinihk Place - La Ronge, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Indian Head Theatre and Community Arts Inc. - Indian Head, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Fri, Aug 1, 2025 to Tue, Sep 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Wed, Oct 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Station Arts Centre Cooperative - Rosthern, SK.Thu, Jan 1, 2026 to Mon, Feb 23, 2026 at the Grand Coteau Heritage and Cultural Centre - Shaunavon, SK.Wed, Apr 1, 2026 to Thu, Apr 23, 2026 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Fri, May 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Humboldt and District Gallery - Humboldt, SK.Sun, Nov 1, 2026 to Mon, Nov 23, 2026 at the John V.

For many Indigenous artists, their love for their culture serves as a significant motivation in their artistic journey, enriching the contemporary art scene with an inherent connection to their roots.\n\nThis exhibition is curated by Holly Aubichon from recent acquisitions to the SK Arts Permanent collection and features the following artists: Stacey Fayant, Marcy Friesen, Sally Milne, Brandon Roy, Cherelle Williams, Audra Blais-Boulianne, Maureen Ledoux, Russel Iron, Elaine McArthur, and Jordy Ironstar.ExhibitionsSun, Sep 1, 2024 to Mon, Sep 23, 2024 at the Mistasinihk Place - La Ronge, SK.Tue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Brooks Hall - Hudson Bay, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Sat, Nov 23, 2024 at the Indian Head Theatre and Community Arts Inc. - Indian Head, SK.Wed, Jan 1, 2025 to Thu, Jan 23, 2025 at the Biggar Museum and Gallery - Biggar, SK.Tue, Apr 1, 2025 to Fri, May 23, 2025 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Fri, Aug 1, 2025 to Tue, Sep 23, 2025 at the Sherven-Smith Art Gallery - Melfort, SK.Wed, Oct 1, 2025 to Thu, Oct 23, 2025 at the Gallery Works and The Third Dimension - Melville, SK.Sat, Nov 1, 2025 to Tue, Dec 23, 2025 at the Station Arts Centre Cooperative - Rosthern, SK.Thu, Jan 1, 2026 to Mon, Feb 23, 2026 at the Grand Coteau Heritage and Cultural Centre - Shaunavon, SK.Wed, Apr 1, 2026 to Thu, Apr 23, 2026 at the Gallery on 3rd - Manitou  Beach, SK.Fri, May 1, 2026 to Tue, Jun 23, 2026 at the Humboldt and District Gallery - Humboldt, SK.Sun, Nov 1, 2026 to Mon, Nov 23, 2026 at the John V.

The exhibition celebrates the various practices in Indigenous art, ranging from contemporary aesthetics and materials to those rooted in familial traditions.\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, the dedication and labour of love invested in art can be easily overlooked. The concept of \"Labour of love\" in art emphasises the extensive labour involved in the creation process, often infused with familial stories, teachings, and practices passed down through generations. These expressions of love for the practice and culture are condensed into the final artworks, representing hours of devotion and labour. We invite viewers to turn the lamplight on, consider the time and knowledge behind each piece as the artists skilfully worked with familiar and lesser-known materials, revived from their cultural heritage or passed down through mentorship within the art community.

While my inner dialogue is full of anxiety and sadness, the garden, the kitchen, and the studio give me reprieve from these thoughts. Most of the women in my family experience chronic mental or physical illness. But they were not joyless, or weak. Images of them in the garden show strong, happy, and proud women. This is the part of my family history I want to celebrate...

Madeleine states: \"This series expresses gratitude to the matriarchal knowledge that has enabled me to provide for my family, as well as connect to plants, food, land, and people. While my inner dialogue is full of anxiety and sadness, the garden, the kitchen, and the studio give me reprieve from these thoughts. Most of the women in my family experience chronic mental or physical illness. But they were not joyless, or weak. Images of them in the garden show strong, happy, and proud women. This is the part of my family history I want to celebrate... The aim is this: to generate longing for a more intimate relationship with food, to invite the audience to the garden as a source of joy and respite, and to share a simple message of gratitude and the difference that care can make.\"ExhibitionsTue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Shurniak Art Gallery - Assiniboia, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Mon, Dec 23, 2024 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Central Park Library/Arts Centre - Nipawin, SK.Sat, Mar 1, 2025 to Wed, Apr 23, 2025 at the Grand Coteau Heritage and Cultural Centre - Shaunavon, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Mon, Jun 23, 2025 at the Watrous Art & Cultural Centre - Watrous, SK.Tue, Jul 1, 2025 to Sat, Aug 23, 2025 at the John V.

Madeleine states: \"This series expresses gratitude to the matriarchal knowledge that has enabled me to provide for my family, as well as connect to plants, food, land, and people. While my inner dialogue is full of anxiety and sadness, the garden, the kitchen, and the studio give me reprieve from these thoughts. Most of the women in my family experience chronic mental or physical illness. But they were not joyless, or weak. Images of them in the garden show strong, happy, and proud women. This is the part of my family history I want to celebrate... The aim is this: to generate longing for a more intimate relationship with food, to invite the audience to the garden as a source of joy and respite, and to share a simple message of gratitude and the difference that care can make.\"ExhibitionsTue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Shurniak Art Gallery - Assiniboia, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Mon, Dec 23, 2024 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Central Park Library/Arts Centre - Nipawin, SK.Sat, Mar 1, 2025 to Wed, Apr 23, 2025 at the Grand Coteau Heritage and Cultural Centre - Shaunavon, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Mon, Jun 23, 2025 at the Watrous Art & Cultural Centre - Watrous, SK.Tue, Jul 1, 2025 to Sat, Aug 23, 2025 at the John V.

Madeleine states: \"This series expresses gratitude to the matriarchal knowledge that has enabled me to provide for my family, as well as connect to plants, food, land, and people. While my inner dialogue is full of anxiety and sadness, the garden, the kitchen, and the studio give me reprieve from these thoughts. Most of the women in my family experience chronic mental or physical illness. But they were not joyless, or weak. Images of them in the garden show strong, happy, and proud women. This is the part of my family history I want to celebrate... The aim is this: to generate longing for a more intimate relationship with food, to invite the audience to the garden as a source of joy and respite, and to share a simple message of gratitude and the difference that care can make.\"ExhibitionsTue, Oct 1, 2024 to Wed, Oct 23, 2024 at the Shurniak Art Gallery - Assiniboia, SK.Fri, Nov 1, 2024 to Mon, Dec 23, 2024 at the Community pARTners Gallery - Yorkton, SK.Sat, Feb 1, 2025 to Sun, Feb 23, 2025 at the Central Park Library/Arts Centre - Nipawin, SK.Sat, Mar 1, 2025 to Wed, Apr 23, 2025 at the Grand Coteau Heritage and Cultural Centre - Shaunavon, SK.Sun, Jun 1, 2025 to Mon, Jun 23, 2025 at the Watrous Art & Cultural Centre - Watrous, SK.Tue, Jul 1, 2025 to Sat, Aug 23, 2025 at the John V.
