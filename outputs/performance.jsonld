Ryan's music has the power to change your mind with its soulful and thought-provoking lyrics, and he has the ability to challenge even the wittiest poets as he conveys the trials and triumphs of life through his songs.\nIn 2023, Ryan toured with some of Canada’s greatest rock icons Burton Cummings and Tom Cochrane and received rave reviews from audiences. This November, he will be bringing a duo show to Saskatchewan, featuring his longtime friend on keys, Uncle Joel Spillette.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsThu, Nov 14, 2024 @ 7:30 pmTisdale Arts CouncilTicket InfoFri, Nov 15, 2024 @ 7:30 pmLangenburg Arts CouncilBuy TicketsSat, Nov 16, 2024 @ 7:30 pmEstevan Arts CouncilTicket InfoMon, Nov 18, 2024 @ 7:30 pmLeader & District Arts CouncilTicket InfoTue, Nov 19, 2024 @ 7:30 pmSwift Current Arts CouncilBuy TicketsWed, Nov 20, 2024 @ 7:30 pmAssiniboia & District Arts CouncilTicket Info#    "

In addition, they will lean on folk musical idioms, such as Celtic, Roots, and Americana. Tom and Kalissa have a lovely vocal harmony blend and draw the listener in with great songs played on fiddle, guitar, and jarana (Mexican 8 string guitar). Perhaps one of the most endearing things about the couple is their relaxed and genuine stage banter, and the stories about the songs.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsTue, Oct 22, 2024 @ 7:30 pmBiggar & District Arts CouncilBuy TicketsWed, Oct 23, 2024 @ 7:30 pmAssiniboia & District Arts CouncilTicket InfoThu, Oct 24, 2024 @ 7:30 pmCanora Arts CouncilTicket InfoFri, Oct 25, 2024 @ 7:30 pmYorkton Arts CouncilBuy TicketsSat, Oct 26, 2024 @ 7:30 pmLangenburg Arts CouncilBuy TicketsTue, Oct 29, 2024 @ 7:30 pmMoose Jaw Cultural CentreBuy TicketsWed, Oct 30, 2024 @ 7:30 pmMelfort Arts CouncilBuy TicketsFri, Nov 1, 2024 @ 7:30 pmStation Arts Centre CooperativeBuy Tickets    "
