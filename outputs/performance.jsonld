Like the river from which they draw their name, the trio crosses boundaries and borders, influencing and being influenced in return. The group had a promising start in Beirut, appearing at venues including the Syrian National Symphony Orchestra and the French Embassy before civil war intruded. Thanks to the Artist Protection Fund (APF) which helps musicians in areas of conflict, the group has found refuge in Canada. Hailing from different cultural and religious traditions themselves, the trio is keenly aware of how music transcends the barriers between us. They bring audiences an uplifting blend of baroque, flamenco and blues-inspired classical guitar, as they explore their new land and community in this Prairie Debut tour.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsFri, Jan 31, 2025 @ 7:30 pmRegina Musical ClubBuy Tickets#    "

As songwriters, multi-instrumentalists, producers, and performers, they push genre and social norms. Their 4-piece band live show highlights songs from their recent album, What She Said, showcasing a sound akin to Brandi Carlile, Sheryl Crow and First Aid Kit. The show is dynamic and engaging, with rotating lead vocals, 3-part harmonies and varied instrumentation blending traditional fiddle and mandolin with electric guitar and keyboards. Rumour Mill's goal is to connect with audiences, making each performance enjoyable and relatable through humour and meaningful lyrics.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsTue, Feb 4, 2025 @ 7:30 pmKipling & District Arts CouncilBuy TicketsWed, Feb 5, 2025 @ 8:00 pmLangenburg Arts CouncilBuy TicketsThu, Feb 6, 2025 @ 7:30 pmMelfort Arts CouncilBuy TicketsFri, Feb 7, 2025 @ 7:00 pmLa Ronge Arts CouncilTicket InfoSat, Feb 8, 2025 @ 7:30 pmBiggar & District Arts CouncilBuy TicketsTue, Feb 11, 2025 @ 7:30 pmLloydminster Allied Arts CouncilBuy TicketsWed, Feb 12, 2025 @ 7:30 pmKindersley & District Arts CouncilBuy Tickets    "

Although the music industry told him he didn't fit into any particular genre, he remained steadfast in his desire to share his inspired songwriting with the world. Ryan's music has the power to change your mind with its soulful and thought-provoking lyrics, and he has the ability to challenge even the wittiest poets as he conveys the trials and triumphs of life through his songs.\nIn 2023, Ryan toured with some of Canada’s greatest rock icons Burton Cummings and Tom Cochrane and received rave reviews from audiences. This November, he will be bringing a duo show to Saskatchewan, featuring his longtime friend on keys, Uncle Joel Spillette.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsThu, Nov 14, 2024 @ 7:30 pmTisdale Arts CouncilTicket InfoFri, Nov 15, 2024 @ 7:30 pmLangenburg Arts CouncilBuy TicketsSat, Nov 16, 2024 @ 7:30 pmEstevan Arts CouncilTicket InfoMon, Nov 18, 2024 @ 7:30 pmLeader & District Arts CouncilTicket InfoTue, Nov 19, 2024 @ 7:30 pmSwift Current Arts CouncilBuy TicketsWed, Nov 20, 2024 @ 7:30 pmAssiniboia & District Arts CouncilTicket Info#    "

We had a desire to create feelings of hope, pure joy, generosity and see strangers smiling at each other. This show accomplished that. In 2024, Canadian Rock icon Jay Semko of the Northern Pikes will be joining the Acoustic Sessions line up. This show includes refreshing medley arrangements of Christmas classics, pop classics, and original songs. Heidi, Scott, Jay, and Chris perform many songs together as well as feature their own individual works for a magical evening of storytelling and music to lift the spirit.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsFri, Dec 6, 2024 @ 7:30 pmMelfort Arts CouncilBuy TicketsSun, Dec 15, 2024 @ 7:30 pmSwift Current Arts CouncilBuy Tickets    "

Harkening back to a simpler time, the MMB’s music is infused with tongue in cheek wit, playfulness, and nostalgia. With a mix of catchy originals and contemporary songs reimagined in driving swing, the band’s performance delivers as both classic and fresh. The band  offers a generous variety of sweaty jazz numbers, velvety love songs, and swingin' jump-blues, with plenty of lighthearted stories and laughs along the way.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsWed, Nov 13, 2024 @ 7:30 pmMoosomin & District Arts CouncilTicket InfoThu, Nov 14, 2024 @ 7:30 pmYorkton Arts CouncilBuy TicketsFri, Nov 15, 2024 @ 7:30 pmWatrous Area Arts CouncilTicket InfoSat, Nov 16, 2024 @ 7:30 pmStation Arts Centre CooperativeBuy TicketsWed, Apr 30, 2025 @ 7:30 pmMoose Jaw Cultural CentreBuy TicketsThu, May 1, 2025 @ 7:30 pmKindersley & District Arts CouncilBuy TicketsFri, May 2, 2025 @ 7:30 pmLeader & District Arts CouncilTicket InfoSat, May 3, 2025 @ 7:30 pmEastend Arts CouncilMon, May 5, 2025 @ 7:30 pmKamsack Arts CouncilTue, May 6, 2025 @ 8:00 pmLangenburg Arts CouncilBuy TicketsWed, May 7, 2025 @ 7:30 pmIndian Head Theatre and Community Arts Inc.Buy TicketsFri, May 9, 2025 @ 7:30 pmAssiniboia & District Arts CouncilTicket InfoSat, May 10, 2025 @ 7:30 pmBiggar & District Arts CouncilBuy Tickets    "
