With years of audience interaction and honing their songwriting skills, Heidi and Scott effortlessly engage crowds with their stories and banter, akin to a warm summer night's campfire. Their soul-stirring original tunes captivate hearts, drawing inspiration from their musical roots, and their cover selection spans Motown, 70s Disco, RnB, jazz, country, and rock, delivering a blend reminiscent of Chris Stapleton, Emmylou Harris, Joe Cocker, and Bonnie Raitt.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsThu, Jan 9, 2025 @ 7:30 pmMoosomin & District Arts CouncilTicket InfoFri, Jan 10, 2025 @ 7:30 pmKipling & District Arts CouncilBuy TicketsSat, Jan 11, 2025 @ 7:30 pmHumboldt Area Arts CouncilTicket InfoWed, Jan 15, 2025 @ 7:30 pmKamsack Arts CouncilFri, Jan 17, 2025 @ 7:30 pmLuseland Arts CouncilTicket InfoSat, Jan 18, 2025 @ 7:30 pmQuill Plains Regional Arts Council (QPRAC) - MainTicket Info    "

The group had a promising start in Beirut, appearing at venues including the Syrian National Symphony Orchestra and the French Embassy before civil war intruded. Thanks to the Artist Protection Fund (APF) which helps musicians in areas of conflict, the group has found refuge in Canada. Hailing from different cultural and religious traditions themselves, the trio is keenly aware of how music transcends the barriers between us. They bring audiences an uplifting blend of baroque, flamenco and blues-inspired classical guitar, as they explore their new land and community in this Prairie Debut tour.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsFri, Jan 31, 2025 @ 7:30 pmRegina Musical ClubBuy Tickets#    "

As songwriters, multi-instrumentalists, producers, and performers, they push genre and social norms. Their 4-piece band live show highlights songs from their recent album, What She Said, showcasing a sound akin to Brandi Carlile, Sheryl Crow and First Aid Kit. The show is dynamic and engaging, with rotating lead vocals, 3-part harmonies and varied instrumentation blending traditional fiddle and mandolin with electric guitar and keyboards. Rumour Mill's goal is to connect with audiences, making each performance enjoyable and relatable through humour and meaningful lyrics.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsTue, Feb 4, 2025 @ 7:30 pmKipling & District Arts CouncilBuy TicketsWed, Feb 5, 2025 @ 8:00 pmLangenburg Arts CouncilBuy TicketsThu, Feb 6, 2025 @ 7:30 pmMelfort Arts CouncilBuy TicketsFri, Feb 7, 2025 @ 7:00 pmLa Ronge Arts CouncilTicket InfoSat, Feb 8, 2025 @ 7:30 pmBiggar & District Arts CouncilBuy TicketsTue, Feb 11, 2025 @ 7:30 pmLloydminster Allied Arts CouncilBuy TicketsWed, Feb 12, 2025 @ 7:30 pmKindersley & District Arts CouncilBuy Tickets    "
