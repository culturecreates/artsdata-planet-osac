The Poltava Ensemble’s roots in Saskatchewan’s cultural scene began in 1922 with the formation of a children’s string orchestra and since that time the Ensemble has grown to include dancers, singers and musicians. The Poltava Dancers, directed by Lisa Wanner, is a male and female adult ensemble whose dancers have a high level of technical training in Ukrainian dance, ballet and folk dance. The Poltava Orchestra, under the direction of Cade Eastwood, brings to life the rich heritage of Ukrainian folk music, whether it accompanies the dancers or is featured as a performing entity unto itself.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsSun, Jan 26, 2025 @ 2:00 pmWatrous Area Arts CouncilTicket Info    "

Ryan's music has the power to change your mind with its soulful and thought-provoking lyrics, and he has the ability to challenge even the wittiest poets as he conveys the trials and triumphs of life through his songs.\nIn 2023, Ryan toured with some of Canada’s greatest rock icons Burton Cummings and Tom Cochrane and received rave reviews from audiences. This November, he will be bringing a duo show to Saskatchewan, featuring his longtime friend on keys, Uncle Joel Spillette.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsThu, Nov 14, 2024 @ 7:30 pmTisdale Arts CouncilTicket InfoFri, Nov 15, 2024 @ 7:30 pmLangenburg Arts CouncilBuy TicketsSat, Nov 16, 2024 @ 7:30 pmEstevan Arts CouncilTicket InfoMon, Nov 18, 2024 @ 7:30 pmLeader & District Arts CouncilTicket InfoTue, Nov 19, 2024 @ 7:30 pmSwift Current Arts CouncilBuy TicketsWed, Nov 20, 2024 @ 7:30 pmAssiniboia & District Arts CouncilTicket Info#    "

We had a desire to create feelings of hope, pure joy, generosity and see strangers smiling at each other. This show accomplished that. In 2024, Canadian Rock icon Jay Semko of the Northern Pikes will be joining the Acoustic Sessions line up. This show includes refreshing medley arrangements of Christmas classics, pop classics, and original songs. Heidi, Scott, Jay, and Chris perform many songs together as well as feature their own individual works for a magical evening of storytelling and music to lift the spirit.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsFri, Dec 6, 2024 @ 7:30 pmMelfort Arts CouncilBuy TicketsSun, Dec 15, 2024 @ 7:30 pmSwift Current Arts CouncilBuy Tickets    "

You will be treated to an array of genres, like Celtic, Folk, Singer-Songwriter, Latin, Mexican, and Roots music sung in both English and Spanish to represent their respective Mexican and Chilean heritages. In addition, they will lean on folk musical idioms, such as Celtic, Roots, and Americana. Tom and Kalissa have a lovely vocal harmony blend and draw the listener in with great songs played on fiddle, guitar, and jarana (Mexican 8 string guitar). Perhaps one of the most endearing things about the couple is their relaxed and genuine stage banter, and the stories about the songs.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsTue, Oct 22, 2024 @ 7:30 pmBiggar & District Arts CouncilBuy TicketsWed, Oct 23, 2024 @ 7:30 pmAssiniboia & District Arts CouncilTicket InfoThu, Oct 24, 2024 @ 7:30 pmCanora Arts CouncilTicket InfoFri, Oct 25, 2024 @ 7:30 pmYorkton Arts CouncilBuy TicketsSat, Oct 26, 2024 @ 7:30 pmLangenburg Arts CouncilBuy TicketsTue, Oct 29, 2024 @ 7:30 pmMoose Jaw Cultural CentreBuy TicketsWed, Oct 30, 2024 @ 7:30 pmMelfort Arts CouncilBuy TicketsFri, Nov 1, 2024 @ 7:30 pmStation Arts Centre CooperativeBuy Tickets    "

Tom and Kalissa have a lovely vocal harmony blend and draw the listener in with great songs played on fiddle, guitar, and jarana (Mexican 8 string guitar). Perhaps one of the most endearing things about the couple is their relaxed and genuine stage banter, and the stories about the songs.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsTue, Oct 22, 2024 @ 7:30 pmBiggar & District Arts CouncilBuy TicketsWed, Oct 23, 2024 @ 7:30 pmAssiniboia & District Arts CouncilTicket InfoThu, Oct 24, 2024 @ 7:30 pmCanora Arts CouncilTicket InfoFri, Oct 25, 2024 @ 7:30 pmYorkton Arts CouncilBuy TicketsSat, Oct 26, 2024 @ 7:30 pmLangenburg Arts CouncilBuy TicketsTue, Oct 29, 2024 @ 7:30 pmMoose Jaw Cultural CentreBuy TicketsWed, Oct 30, 2024 @ 7:30 pmMelfort Arts CouncilBuy TicketsFri, Nov 1, 2024 @ 7:30 pmStation Arts Centre CooperativeBuy Tickets    "
