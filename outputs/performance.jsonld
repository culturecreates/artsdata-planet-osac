Like the river from which they draw their name, the trio crosses boundaries and borders, influencing and being influenced in return. The group had a promising start in Beirut, appearing at venues including the Syrian National Symphony Orchestra and the French Embassy before civil war intruded. Thanks to the Artist Protection Fund (APF) which helps musicians in areas of conflict, the group has found refuge in Canada. Hailing from different cultural and religious traditions themselves, the trio is keenly aware of how music transcends the barriers between us. They bring audiences an uplifting blend of baroque, flamenco and blues-inspired classical guitar, as they explore their new land and community in this Prairie Debut tour.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsFri, Jan 31, 2025 @ 7:30 pmRegina Musical ClubBuy Tickets#    "

Harkening back to a simpler time, the MMB’s music is infused with tongue in cheek wit, playfulness, and nostalgia. With a mix of catchy originals and contemporary songs reimagined in driving swing, the band’s performance delivers as both classic and fresh. The band  offers a generous variety of sweaty jazz numbers, velvety love songs, and swingin' jump-blues, with plenty of lighthearted stories and laughs along the way.AppearancesDatePresented ByTicketsWed, Apr 30, 2025 @ 7:30 pmMoose Jaw Cultural CentreBuy TicketsThu, May 1, 2025 @ 7:30 pmKindersley & District Arts CouncilBuy TicketsFri, May 2, 2025 @ 7:30 pmLeader & District Arts CouncilTicket InfoSat, May 3, 2025 @ 7:30 pmEastend Arts CouncilMon, May 5, 2025 @ 7:30 pmKamsack Arts CouncilTue, May 6, 2025 @ 8:00 pmLangenburg Arts CouncilBuy TicketsWed, May 7, 2025 @ 7:30 pmIndian Head Theatre and Community Arts Inc.Buy TicketsFri, May 9, 2025 @ 7:30 pmAssiniboia & District Arts CouncilTicket InfoSat, May 10, 2025 @ 7:30 pmBiggar & District Arts CouncilBuy Tickets    "
